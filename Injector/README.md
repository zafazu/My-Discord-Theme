# DarkVision Injector

A simple Discord Client injector.

## How to Use

1. **Download** the ZIP  
2. **Extract** the contents  
3. Move the extracted folder into your **Documents** directory  
4. Run **start.bat**  
5. A **separate copy of Discord** will be created  

**!! THIS DOES NOT MODIFY YOUR ORIGINAL DISCORD INSTALLATION !!**  
**!! YOU CAN STILL USE YOUR NORMAL DISCORD LIKE BEFORE !!**

6. If it doesn’t start: **fully close Discord** and try again  
7. Install **Vencord** into the new Discord installation:  
   `AppData/Local/Discord-Inject-xxxx`

## Note

You can edit your Discord shortcut to point to `start.bat` for easier access.
